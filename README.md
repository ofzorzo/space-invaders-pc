# space-invaders-pc

This is a simple remake of the classic Space Invaders game. Multiple types of interaction were added to the game. The spaceship can be moved by using the keyboard arrows or by moving the cursor; you can shoot by pressing the space key or by aiming with the cursor. You can choose whichever fits you best in the **Settings** menu.

To play the game, simply download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/ofzorzo/space-invaders-pc/releases) or from [this direct link](https://github.com/ofzorzo/space-invaders-pc/releases/download/2.0.0/Space_Invaders_PC_2.0.0.zip). Extract the files to your desired destination and execute "**Space Invaders.jar**".

## Building and running

Alternatively, you can build the project yourself by going to the root folder and executing:
```

```

After that, execute the following command to run the game:

```
